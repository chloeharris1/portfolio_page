# Advanced CSS Portfolio Page

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria
This website is a responsive portfolio page that showcases the applications and work that I will accomplish in this bootcamp. 

This site is designed to be responsive across multiple screen sizes using nested Flexboxes and Media Queries.
